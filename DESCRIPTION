Description: Performs canonical correlation for survey data, including 
  multiple tests of significance for secondary canonical correlations. 
  A key feature of this package is that it incorporates survey data structure 
  directly in a novel test of significance via a sequence of simple linear 
  regression models on the canonical variates. See reference - Cruz-Cano, 
  Cohen, and Mead-Morse (2024) "Canonical Correlation Analysis of Survey data: the SurveyCC R package"
